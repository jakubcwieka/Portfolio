# Welcome! 
I'm Jakub, an emerging data analyst, scientist and researcher with sociological background. Experience and intuition gained from social research allows me to uncover hidden patterns and navigate the analytic process with confidence. 
I currently specialize in multivariate methods - regression, classification, dimension reduction. I also know a bunch of structural equation modelling, mixed models and item response theory. 
I mostly work in R and STATA, though I'm also familiar with MS Power BI and SQL from the business perspective. 

**I look forward to working with you and solving some demanding problems**! 

**Note**: This portfolio is in constant development, as I am passionate about my work and I always strive to progress and deliver even better, more coherent analysis.

# Projects 

### [Employee Attrition Analysis and Prediction](https://github.com/jakubcwieka/Employee-Attrition-Analysis-and-Prediction/tree/main) 

This analysis aims to understand employee attrition patterns and build a model that will predict such occurences with high sensitivity. 

To achieve this goal, I conduct:
- **Data Preparation:**
dealing with missing values, omitting redundant variables, setting appropriate measurement levels
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** inspecting possible reliationships via graphs, multivariate plots, correlations, descriptive statistics
- **Conditional Random Forest:** prediction of employee attrition usiing *cforest* package
- **Extreme Gradient Boost Classification Tree:** grid-search for optimal hyperparameters using *caret* package, 5-fold cross-validation, hyperparametrs tuning
- **Logistic Regression:** based on the knowledge acquired in previous steps, I fit a logistic regression model that reflects the characteristics of the observed attrition patterns.

Models were evaluated using AUC, AUC PR, confusion matrix, classification errors, cross-validation and variable importance. 

The analysis was made in R, and the final report assembled in LaTeX.
