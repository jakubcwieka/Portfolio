# Welcome! 
I'm Jakub, an emerging data analyst, scientist and researcher with sociological background. Experience and intuition gained from social research allows me to uncover hidden patterns and navigate the analytic process with confidence. 
I currently specialize in multivariate methods - regression, classification, dimension reduction. I also know a bunch of structural equation modelling, mixed models and item response theory. 
I mostly work in R and STATA, though I'm also familiar with MS Power BI and SQL from the business perspective. 

**I look forward to working with you and solving some demanding problems**! 

**Note**: This portfolio is in constant development, as I am passionate about my work and I always strive to progress and deliver even better, more coherent analysis.
